Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.

Get Spark from the downloads page of the project website. This documentation is for Spark version 1.3.0. The downloads page contains Spark packages for many popular HDFS versions. If you’d like to build Spark from scratch, visit Building Spark.

Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS). It’s easy to run locally on one machine — all you need is to have java installed on your system PATH, or the JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to a Java installation.

Spark runs on Java 6+ and Python 2.6+. For the Scala API, Spark 1.3.0 uses Scala 2.10. You will need to use a compatible Scala version (2.10.x).
